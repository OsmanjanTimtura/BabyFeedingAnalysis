#This is definitely a fun experience analyzing feeding data of my own baby.
#I will update more and more of this program as more data is going to be analyzed for my baby.
In this program, I read baby's breast milk feeding data stored in csv file.
Extracted and separetd the data by month.
Divided the data into 24 time ranges, each hour is 1 range.
Calculated the average for each time for each month.
Made plot using the range as X axis, and average feeding of that time range as y axis.
